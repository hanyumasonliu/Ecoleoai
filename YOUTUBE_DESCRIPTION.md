**DESCRIPTION:**

🌍 Track your carbon footprint as easily as taking a photo with Carbon Tracer AI — powered by Google's Gemini 3 Flash!

We built an intelligent carbon tracking app that uses Gemini Vision to analyze everyday objects and estimate their environmental impact in real-time. Point your camera at food, products, or receipts, and Gemini instantly calculates the carbon footprint from raw materials to disposal.

✨ KEY FEATURES:
📸 Smart Scanning (4 modes) - Product, Food, Receipt & Barcode
🚗 GPS Transport Tracking with auto-mode detection
✈️ Flight Emissions Calculator (Google Travel Impact Model API)
⚡ Energy Monitoring with EPA emission factors
📊 Daily Carbon Budget & Gamification
🤖 AI-Powered Coaching

🔧 TECH STACK:
• Gemini 3 Flash (gemini-3-flash-preview) - Primary AI model
• Google Maps Directions & Places API (New)
• Google Travel Impact Model API
• React Native + Expo SDK 54
• TypeScript
• Open Food Facts API

🎯 WHY IT MATTERS:
Most people don't ignore climate impact because they don't care — they ignore it because it's too hard to see. Carbon Tracer AI makes sustainability data as accessible as tracking your steps.

💡 HIGHLIGHTS:
✅ Real Gemini 3 integration (not a mockup!)
✅ Auto-discovers flights when you don't have a flight number
✅ Multi-mode transport comparison (walk/bike/car/bus/train)
✅ Location autocomplete with Places API (New)
✅ Production-ready TypeScript codebase
✅ Lifecycle analysis based on EPA & scientific data

📈 THE VISION:
As carbon accounting becomes standard for companies, individuals deserve the same intelligence. We're making carbon tracking as ubiquitous as calorie counting — because when you can see your impact, you can change it.
